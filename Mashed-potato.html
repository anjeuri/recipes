     <h3> Step-by-Step Instructions:</h3>
     <ol>
            <li> <strong>Prep the potatoes: </strong> Wash and peel the potatoes. Cut them into even, 1.5-inch chunks to ensure uniform cooking.
            </li>
            <li> <strong>Boil the potatoes: </strong> Place the cut potatoes in a large pot and cover them with cold water by about one inch. Add a generous amount of salt to the water (about 1 tablespoon). Bring the water to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer.
            </li>
            <li> <strong>Cook until tender: </strong> Cook for 15–25 minutes, or until the potatoes are easily pierced with a fork. Do not overcook them, as this can make them waterlogged.
            </li>
            <li> <strong>Drain and dry: </strong>Carefully drain the potatoes in a colander. Return the empty pot to the stove over low heat and add the drained potatoes back in for 1-2 minutes, shaking gently to evaporate any excess moisture. This key step prevents watery or gluey mashed potatoes.
            </li>
            <li> <strong>Mash and mix: </strong> Remove the pot from the heat. Add the softened butter and begin mashing with a potato masher or a ricer for the smoothest results. Gradually pour in the warm milk (or cream) while continuing to mash until you reach your desired consistency. Avoid overmixing, especially with an electric mixer, as this can make the potatoes gummy.
            </li>
            <li> <strong>Season and serve: </strong>Stir in salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately, optionally garnished with fresh chives or an extra pat of butter. 
            </li>
     </ol>
